                                Chris founded Alton Computer Solutions in 2006. He brought all the skills he learned
                                while working as a Computer (and Printer!) Technician for 12 years for a family-owned
                                computer support business. Chris has nearly three decades of experience in creating
                                hardware and software solutions for small businesses. He enjoys working closely with
                                customers to create systems that adapt to their unique business needs. He combines the
                                fast-paced learning necessary for computer technician work with his love of tinkering
                                with machines. The first machine he restored from the ground up was a 1963 Volkswagen
                                Beetle as a teenager. When he’s not at work, you’ll find him salmon fishing and crabbing
                                on his Klamath 19 GTX, hiking, and spending time with his wife and two daughters.

                                Blake began working at Alton Computer Solutions in 2017. He started his Computer
                                Technician career as a helpdesk monkey in 2009, although he’s been playing with
                                computers since the late 90s. Previous employers include Icicle and University of
                                Washington’s Forestry and STEM departments. Blake likes troubleshooting and solving
                                problems. He also loves to repair and restore cars (Subarus and a 1971 Opel GT) and
                                two-stroke motorcycles (a 1969 Yamaha R3 and a 1969 Yamaha YG5-T). Blake’s also a rally
                                racer, a record loving hipster, and owner of a pretty sweet stereo.

                                Rex began working at Alton Computer Solutions in February 2018. Prior to this, he was
                                always in school or working odd jobs. His hobbies are partially decided by the season.
                                During the warmer months, Rex enjoys playing a round of golf or smoking up some
                                delicious meats. In the fall and winter, he tends to stay indoors more often, whether it
                                is to watch his favorite teams or play video games with his friends. He has recently
                                taken an interest in red wines, so if you have recommendations feel free to let him
                                know.
