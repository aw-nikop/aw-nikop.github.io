<h1 class="display-5">Why you should outsource your IT as a small business<br> <small class="text-muted">By Niko
        Permilovsky</small></h1>
<p>We all have a person that handles our taxes, a bookkeeper, and certainly a lawyer. These people become a part of our
    lives and an extension of our business. They know how we think, our goals, and our strategy. They have their own
    lives independent of us. We do not keep them in-house and pay them a salary because it would not make financial
    sense considering that they work infrequently.</p>
<p>Similarly, outsourcing your IT is a better financial decision for many small businesses. The median salary for IT
    support employees with similar experience to ours (15+ years) is <a
        href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/it-support-salary-SRCH_KO0,10.htm">83k/yr according to Glassdoor</a>.
    This means that you
    will be spending $7,000 a month on a service that you will be using irregularly.</p>
<p>Instead, that money could be put towards a specialized team of local Seattle IT professionals who have dealt with all
    sorts of problems, are constantly up to date on the latest IT/Cybersecurity news and will know your system inside
    and out. We take a proactive approach to IT ensuring that your devices will not suddenly go out of commission. You
    can factor in regular maintenance and retainer into a budget for predictability.</p>
