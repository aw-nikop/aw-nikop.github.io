# Why you should outsource your IT as a small business
*By Niko Permilovsky*

We all have a person that handles our taxes, a bookkeeper, and certainly a lawyer. These people become a part of our lives and an extension of our business. They know how we think, our goals, and our strategy. They have their own lives independent of us. We do not keep them in-house and pay them a salary because it would not make financial sense considering that they work infrequently.

Similarly, outsourcing your IT is a better financial decision for many small businesses. The median salary for IT support employees with similar experience to ours (15+ years) is [83k/yr according to Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/it-support-salary-SRCH_KO0,10.htm). This means that you will be spending $7,000 a month on a service that you will be using irregularly.

Instead, that money could be put towards a specialized team of local Seattle IT professionals who have dealt with all sorts of problems, are constantly up to date on the latest IT/Cybersecurity news and will know your system inside and out. We take a proactive approach to IT ensuring that your devices will not suddenly go out of commission. You can factor in regular maintenance and retainer into a budget for predictability.

Let us go into these in more depth.

## Personable

We have long-standing relationships with IT vendors, which means we fully understand how our products function. We can also visit your business promptly to install and fix hardware issues.
