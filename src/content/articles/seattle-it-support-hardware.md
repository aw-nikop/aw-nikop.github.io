# Seattle IT Support & Hardware That Scales With Your Team
*By Chris Alton*


  Seattle businesses rely on standardized, dependable technology to keep teams productive—whether in the office, at home, or on the move. Alton Computer Solutions sources, deploys, and supports business‑grade hardware and networks across the greater Seattle area, leveraging vendor relationships for cost‑effective, top‑quality systems.

  ##### What We Deliver

  - Hardware procurement from trusted brands: Dell, Lenovo, Microsoft, Ubiquiti, Netgear.
- Office moves & new builds: planning, cabling coordination, rack/closet setup, device cutover.
- Wi‑Fi design & remediation: site surveys, heatmaps, access point placement to eliminate dead spots.
- Remote work enablement: standardized WFH laptop kits, docking, monitors, and peripherals.
- Security cameras: design and installation for offices, warehouses, and retail.
- Servers & storage: on‑prem NAS and hybrid setups for backup and file sharing.
- Ongoing support: monitoring, patching, and lifecycle management.

  ##### Why Standardizing Employee Tech Matters

  Using the same hardware and software stack across the organization increases uptime, security, and support velocity. Identical builds reduce variables and mean faster troubleshooting. Consistent patching and device encryption strengthen security. Standard images and profiles make onboarding predictable. Bulk purchasing lowers total cost, while uniform apps and settings improve collaboration and the user experience. A standardized baseline also simplifies compliance and scales cleanly as you grow.

  ##### Recommended Baseline Stack (Example)

  - Laptops: Business‑class Dell or Lenovo with TPM, SSD, 16–32 GB RAM.
- OS & productivity: Windows 11 + Microsoft 365 Business.
- Networking: Ubiquiti UniFi switches and Wi‑Fi 6/6E access points.
- Storage/backup: NAS with snapshot replication and offsite backup.
- Edge: Netgear ProSAFE/Smart Managed switching where appropriate.
- Security: MFA, device encryption, automated patching, centralized logging.

  (Configurations are tailored to workload, budget, and growth plans.)
