<h1 class="display-5">How Alton Computer Solutions Automated Daily, Tedious Tasks<br>
    <small class="text-muted">By Niko Permilovsky</small>
</h1>
<p>We all have repetitive computing tasks that we dread. Maybe it is invoicing, patient intake forms, copy/pasting excel
    rows from one sheet to another, or updating inventory. It’s not a perplexing task, it’s just tiresome. You can’t
    help but wonder, “isn’t there a way to make this go faster?”</p>
<p>Well, there is!</p>
<p>Here is how we reduced a daily backup check-and-verify task from 30 minutes to instantaneous using Power Automate and
    a custom website we created.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="/solutions/backup">Backup and Disaster Recovery Plan</a> we monitor our customer’s backups to
    check if successful; and if
    something went wrong, such as a network error, we investigate and fix it.</p>
<p>The process of checking all the reports from the backup devices sent to our Outlook email is time consuming. The
    reports come in detailing workstation, server, and cloud backups. There isn’t a nice, clean, and centralized
    dashboard where all the reports go to.</p>
<h2 class="section">Part 1: Power Automate</h2>
<p>We automated the manual email backup checking process to save time and eliminate human error. There are three
    constants: The “deadline” all the reports came in by, a clear distinction between success and failure, and the
    general format that the message has. All the reports come in by 8:30, which is when our process starts.</p>
<p>Using Power Automate through Microsoft 365 we integrated all the backup emails very neatly. We created a daily task
    that gathers the emails into one bucket. It then loops through them one by one and sorts them into smaller
    buckets,
    depending on the backup type – whether workstation, server, or cloud. From there we save it all to the server and
    delete the email from the mailbox to save space.</p>
<h2 class="section">Part 2: Parsing</h2>
<p>Next, we need to parse the emails so we can display them in a clean, human-readable report. Parsing emails is
    straightforward: take the title, the device name, the date, and the description, and convert it into a row. We
    gather all the rows into one table and send it to the webserver.</p>
<h2 class="section">Part 3: Displaying The Report – the user-friendly results</h2>
<p>The last part is displaying the results back so they can be accessible to all of Altonworks’ employees. We can do
    this by running a webserver on a Virtual Machine. Every morning, the report is ready first thing by clicking on
    a bookmarked link in a web browser. It contains all the backup reports for each of our customers in a simple, easy
    to read format. We can even set it to print every morning!</p>
