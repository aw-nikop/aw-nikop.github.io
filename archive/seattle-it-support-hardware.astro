  <h5>Why Standardizing Employee Tech Matters</h5>
  <p>
    Using the same hardware and software stack across the organization increases uptime, security, and support velocity. Identical builds reduce variables and mean faster troubleshooting. Consistent patching and device encryption strengthen security. Standard images and profiles make onboarding predictable. Bulk purchasing lowers total cost, while uniform apps and settings improve collaboration and the user experience. A standardized baseline also simplifies compliance and scales cleanly as you grow.
  </p>
  <h5>Recommended Baseline Stack (Example)</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Laptops: Business‑class Dell or Lenovo with TPM, SSD, 16–32 GB RAM.</li>
    <li>OS &amp; productivity: Windows 11 + Microsoft 365 Business.</li>
    <li>Networking: Ubiquiti UniFi switches and Wi‑Fi 6/6E access points.</li>
    <li>Storage/backup: NAS with snapshot replication and offsite backup.</li>
    <li>Edge: Netgear ProSAFE/Smart Managed switching where appropriate.</li>
    <li>Security: MFA, device encryption, automated patching, centralized logging.</li>
  </ul>
